#
## summary of all public commands (i.e. not idented)
#
# (source help.sh; help help.sh)
# 
## summary of all documented commands
#
# (source help.sh; HELP_BOL=no; help help.sh)
# 
## detailed description of a single command
#
# (source help.sh; help help.sh help)
#
 
# Provide your script with a help function:
# 
# function help {
#     (source help.sh; help $0 $@)
# }

#@help
#+FILE [COMMAND] -- briefly describe commands extracted from FILE
#
# This function parses special comments in the shell script FILE in
# order to display a summary of all interactive commands FILE supports.
#
# If COMMAND is given and names a existing command in FILE, a longer
# description of just COMMAND is displayed.
#
# The behavior of `help' can be influenced with these environment
# variables:
#
# - HELP_COL (Default: 25)
#
# the column where the command summary should start
#
# - HELP_BOL (Default: "yes")
#
# if set to "yes", then only comments starting in column 0 are taken
# into account when parsing a command's documentation.
